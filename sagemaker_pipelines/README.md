# Get started with SageMaker Pipelines

## Introduction
Amazon SageMaker Model Building Pipelines is a tool for building machine learning pipelines that take advantage of direct SageMaker integration. In this tutorial, you will assume the role of a machine learning developer working at a bank. You have been asked to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will enroll for a certificate of deposit (CD). The model will be trained on the marketing dataset that contains information on customer demographics, responses to marketing events, and external factors.

## Goals
This example notebook will help you create a pipeline that consists of the following steps: Processing, Training, Model Evaluation, Register Model and Condition Steps. Successfull completed pipeline looks like the below:
