    "This notebook demonstrates the use of Amazon SageMaker XGBoost to train and host a regression model. [XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io) is a popular and efficient machine learning algorithm used for regression and classification tasks on tabular datasets. It implements a technique know as gradient boosting on trees, and performs remarkably well in machine learning competitions, and gets a lot of attention from customers. \n",

More details about the original dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.names). Age of abalone is to be predicted from eight physical measurements.  \n",

For example, you can set up Lambda/EventBridge to trigger the execution of a SageMaker training pipeline when a new training dataset is uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket.\n",

However, comparing to SageMaker Pipelines, a step function takes more effort to build, and its integration with SageMaker studio and SageMaker other features is worse.\n",
